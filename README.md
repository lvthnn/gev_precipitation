# Application of Bayesian methods to modelling of extreme precipitation data

Final project for the STÆ004F Random Effects Models course.
Here we perform an analysis of annual precipitation maxima from
Southern England over a time period of 132 years. The data are
modelled using a Bayesian framework where the response layer is
assigned a generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution and latent
layers are modelled with varying levels of complexity.
