# Application of Bayesian methods to modelling of extreme precipitation data

An analysis of annual precipitation maxima from Southern England overa time
period of 132 years. The data are modelled using a Bayesian framework where the
response layer is assigned a generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution and
latent layers are modelled with varying levels of complexity.
